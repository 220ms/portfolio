        description: `In this project we were tasked with creating a product that solved a problem in the legal sector and did so by using AI.
         So for this hackathon we build up an application that leverage Pythons artifical intelligence libraries like opencv to compare and contrast images as well as text to the Australian national trademark registry.
         In doing so we looked at the shapes present in the image, the text on the image as well as the colors contained in the image. From this data we were then able to pass this data into a neural network which then evaluated
         the uploaded image in those 3 categories and produced a likelihood score that the image would be copyright free and didn't conflict with any previously filed material. In this project I mainly focused on the UI design 
         and creating this using the pygame module in python. In the end we ended up winning the hackathon with our project idea and prototype.`,
